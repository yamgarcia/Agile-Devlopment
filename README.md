#Agile Leaning

##1

1. The main focus of Agile is always responding to changes.
2. Incremental Software delivery (development) is:
   - Delivering new functionality to the stakeholders one requirement at a time
3. Iterative software delivery (development) is:
   - Creating a rough piece in the first iteration and then refining that piece over
     the following few iterations.
4. In Agile, working software is the primary measure of progress in a typical software
   development project.
5. Principle #2 of the Agile Manifesto states that we welcome changing requirements,
   even late in development.
6. 4 pillars of the Agile manifesto:
   - individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
   - working software over comprehensive documentation;
   - customer collaboration over contract negotiation; and.
   - responding to change over following a plan.
7. Which are Agile Management disciplines/frameworks:
   - Scrum; YES
   - Extreme Programming; NO
   - Lean/Kanban; YES
8. Project requirements that are uncertain and volatile would do well using an
   agile development approach:
9. All 12 Principles in Agile Manifesto

   1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
      continuous delivery of valuable software
   2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
      Agile processes harness change for the customer's
      competitive advantage;
   3. Deliver working software frequently, from 1 to 4 weeks, with a
      preference to the shorter timescale;
   4. Business people and developers must work together daily
      throughout the project;
   5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
      environment and support they need, and trust them to get the
      job done;
   6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying
      information to and within a development team is a face-to-face
      conversation;
   7. Working software is the primary measure of progress;
   8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The
      sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a
      constant pace indefinitely;
   9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
      enhances agility;
   10. Simplicity is the art of maximizing the amount of work not
       done is essential;
   11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge
       from self-organizing teams;
   12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
       effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly;

10. Agile is all about short development iterations that produce increments of working
    software, which means user acceptance tested.
11. Agile techniques:
    - Continuous collaboration; YES
    - Frequent replanning; YES
    - Running all tests at the end of the iteration; NO
12. Refactoring means the continual improvement of program code;
13. In the planning of an agile project, the budgeting process requires that development
    iterations must be both time and budget boxed.
14. It is recommended that a software build for an agile project be done at least once a
    day.

1. The 3 C's (Card, Conversion, Confirmation) of User Stories;
2. On the back of the user story card we write the user acceptance criteria;
3. A very large user story is called an Epic;
4. When we group large user stories together, we call this grouping a theme;
5. The user stories for the project are all placed in the Product Backlog, meaning the
   scope.
6. User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing
   about requirements to talking about them
7. 3 sections of the user story iceberg in sequence from top to bottom
   - Sprint;
   - Release;
   - Future Releases;
8. The user of User Stories helps create a balance between business and technology.

1. In the Scrum planning meeting, the Product Owner defines the high-level user stories
   and the team estimates them in Story Points
2. 3 outputs/deliverables the are the outcome of the Scrum Planning ceremony:
   - Product backlog;
   - Product roadmap;
   - Technical Roadmap;
3. Part 2 of the Sprint Planning Meeting:
   - The team creates tasks to turn the backlog into working functionality;
   - Tasks are estimated in gours, usually 4 to 16;
   - Team members sign up for tasks, they are not assigned;
4. 3 questions answered by each team member during the daily scrum:
   - What I have done yesterday;
   - What I will do today;
   - What are my impediments;
5. The burndown chart measures the team’s daily progress;
6. The sprint review meeting includes:
   - The introduction of the Sprint Goal and the Burndown Chart;
   - An interactive demo of each item in the sprint goal;
   - Review of the sprint with the “pluses” and the “deltas”;
7. The Sprint Retrospective is facilitated by the Scrum Master.
8. In Part 1 of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the team chooses the Sprint Backlog.
9. 3 columns on a typical Scrum Retrospective Board:
   - Success;
   - Challenges;
   - Actions;
10. 5 columns on a typical Scrum Board:
    - Story;
    - To do;
    - In Progress;
    - To verify;
    - Done

1. 3 outputs/deliverables from the Scrum Planning ceremony:
   - Product Backlog;
   - Product roadmap;
   - Technical Roadmap;
2. In Scrum, we need a “way of estimation that reminds us that our estimates are
   actually guessed”.
3. When we conduct Estimation Relatively we call this comparison estimating.
4. A relative size Estimate for a development user story includes:
   - Documentation;
   - Testing;
   - Design;
   - Analysis;
   - Programming;
5. In the planning Onion, agile teams plan at the innermost 3 levels of the onion which
   are.
   - Daily scrum;
     - Iteration;
     - Release
6. Story points are typically based on a combination of the size and complexity of the
   work.
7. When a team begins the estimation process with Story points, the first thing they do
   is to choose a Keystone.
8. Story points are not determined within the team by “the ruling majority” but by the
   team consensus.
9. In planning poker, the most common set of number or number sequence that is used
   today is the Fibonacci sequence number series.
10. Planning poker works because Estimators are required to justify estimates.
11. Velocity is the amount of work planned or completed in a sprint;

1. The bottom layer of Patrick Lencioni’s Pyramid in studying the 5 dysfunctions of a
   team is: Absence Of Trust
2. When we say that a Scrum Team contains all the roles focused on delivering a
   product, we say that the team is: Cross-Functional
3. For Scrum Teams rules and incentives are added by Management
4. In self-organized teams, there are no individual problems, only Team problems.
5. In managing the Sprint Backlog: Estimated work remaining is updated daily.
6. When a Scrum team member hits a roadblock, and the team can help, the team members
   drop what they are doing and Swarm on the problem.
7. The foundation of agile is Projects built around teams.
8. In self-organizing teams management influences the environment.
9. On an Agile team, the Scrum Master is not a Project Manager, but a Servant leader.
10. In self-organizing teams, control is not evil.
11. In Bruce Tuckman’s Model of Team dynamics, there are the 4 stages of team
    growth.
    - Forming
    - Storming
    - Norming
    - Performing

1. In Scrum, the Scrum Master Owns the Process.
2. Scrum Ceremonies:
   - Scrum Planning
   - Sprint Planning
   - Daily Scrum
   - Backlog Grooming
   - Sprint Review
3. The Scrum Master FACILITATES the process to keep the team on track.
4. A Scrum Master Leads the team by going FIRST
5. The Scrum Master is the team GUIDE leading them to the right place at the right
   time.
6. As a Team COACH, the Scrum Master watched and listens.
7. A traditional Project Manager is a Task Master, whereas, in an Agile team, the team
   manages its own tasks.
8. In an Agile Project, detailed planning still occurs, but only in the Iteration/Sprint at
   hand.
9. When the Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum Planning, the Product Roadmap that is
   developed drives the Product Releases.
10. In an agile project, we still do strategic planning activities, but at the Feature level.
11. A traditional Project Manager is responsible for Scope Change Control, but in an
    Agile Project, the Scrum Master ensures that scope is managed by the Product
    Owner with a ranked Product Backlog.
